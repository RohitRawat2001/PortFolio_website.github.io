   <p>What is a Graphic Designer?

    What does a Graphic Designer do?
    Graphic designers combine art and technology to communicate ideas by using a variety of design elements to achieve artistic or decorative effects. They develop the overall layout and production design for advertisements, brochures, magazines, and corporate reports. This usually starts out by producing rough illustrations of design ideas, either by hand sketching or by using a computer program.

    A graphic designer's end goal is to make the company that hired them recognizable and prominent. By using text, images, and a variety of media, they communicate a particular idea or identity to be used in advertising and promotions. Media may include fonts, size, shapes, colors, print design, photography, animation, logos, and billboards.
    
    Graphic designers often collaborate on projects with other graphic designers, digital marketing specialists, multimedia animators, programmers, art directors, and web designers. When using text in layouts, they collaborate closely with copywriters who write the wording and decide whether the words will be put into headlines, paragraphs, lists, or tables.
    
    A graphic designer's responsibilities involve the following:
    
    Meet with clients or the art director to determine the scope of a project
    Advise clients on strategies to reach a particular audience
    Determine the message the design should portray
    Create images that identify a product or convey a message
    Develop graphics and visual or audio images for product illustrations, logos, and websites
    Create designs either by hand or by using computer software packages
    Select colours, images, text style, and layout
    Present the design to clients or the art director
    Incorporate changes recommended by the clients into the final design
    Review designs for errors before printing or publishing them
    Where can the graphic design field take you? There are many avenues you can look at pursuing, such as:
    
    Creative Director - Manage a creative team that creates visuals for product branding, advertising campaigns, etc.
    Art Director - Manage and coordinate between production artists and illustrators to make sure projects are completed on time and to the client’s satisfaction.

    What is the workplace of a Graphic Designer like?

    Graphic design is becoming increasingly important in the sales and marketing of products. Therefore, graphic designers often work closely with people in advertising and promotions, public relations, and marketing. Frequently, designers specialize in a particular category or type of client. For example, some create credits for motion pictures, while others work with print media and create signs or posters. Some individuals with a background in graphic design teach in design schools, colleges, and universities.
    
    Generally speaking, graphic designers work in one of three work environments. Therefore, the answer to this question depends on the option you choose.
    
    Working as an in-house graphic designer
    Working in-house means that you are employed with an established organization and your work revolves around a single brand or a single group of related brands. Graphic designers in these kinds of roles tend to be generalists. They possess a broad range of general design skills so that they are able to meet all the creative needs of the company.
    
    Advantages of working in-house
    
    Perks of a traditional work environment: separation of home and work; collaboration with colleagues in a social workplace; company benefits
    A steady paycheck: stability without having to build up a clientele
    Opportunities to advance: potential to climb the corporate career ladder
    One brand or brand set to develop: singular focus allows designers to develop an in-depth understanding of the organization’s brand, style, and target audiences; opportunity to build a long-term strategy and see the results that it yields.
    Disadvantages of working in-house
    
    More rules: an established company brand can feel restrictive; it requires that you come up with new ideas while adhering to brand guidelines
    More communication: you will likely have to explain and justify your designs to non-designers
    A non-design environment: office space may not be optimized with the designers in mind; there will be fewer, if any, fellow designers to collaborate with
    Working as an agency graphic designer
    Graphic design agencies are hired by outside clients to produce creative work. In this environment, designers typically work with an assortment of brands. Assignments tend to be short-term, project-base, and limited to a specific campaign.
    
    Advantages of working at an agency
    
    Expectation of design excellence: managers and coworkers who are designers and/or familiar with the design world; high expectations of professionalism; diverse opportunities to advance your design skills; generally fewer communication delays than may occur when working with non-designers
    Established processes and mentors: agencies tend to have their processes and systems streamlined, as well as senior designers on staff, which creates productive learning environments for new designers
    Focus on graphic design: non-design tasks are extremely rare; daily work is always within the realm of graphic design
    Disadvantages of working at an agency
    
    Less job security: agencies hire staff to match the contracts they have; if the project list dips, there is a risk of lay-off due to the need to reduce the number of graphic designers
    Rigorous hours: Agency settings are fast-paced, with tight deadlines; occasional late nights to finish a project are not uncommon
    Working as a freelance graphic designer
    Freelance graphic designers are responsible for more than just graphic design. They are responsible for every aspect of their business, from marketing and client relations to bookkeeping and invoicing. The role calls for considerable self-discipline and dedication.
    
    Advantages of working as a freelancer
    
    Location: no commuting; flexibility to work from anywhere with Wi-Fi
    Creative freedom: creative flexibility; select work that challenges and inspires you
    A tailored schedule: tailor your hours to the lifestyle you want, as long as you keep up with the workload and remain productive
    Disadvantages of working as a freelancer
    
    No coworkers: essentially, you will be working alone in relative isolation, in a non-collaborative environment, which may at times challenge your motivation
    Hunting and bidding for work: projects will not land on your desk; you will have to actively seek – and sometimes compete to win – projects
    Unreliable pay without benefits: pay can vary dramatically from month to month, depending on the flow of work; health insurance, maternity leave, and retirement accounts will be your own responsibility
